# test_servers


Outside thie repo on my computer i have a server_starter directory. To start each project i use this command to create a new directory with the starter files.

```
cp -r ../server_starter/ ./[NEW DIR NAME]
```


Then  install necesary dependencies for this project with these: 

```
npm install pg | prisma | mysql
```

```
npm run dev | build & start
```
